To use Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) in your CSS workflow, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install Sass: You can install Sass using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal:

   npm install -g sass



2. Create a Sass file: Create a `.scss` file where you can write your Sass code. For example, you can create a file named `styles.scss`.

3. Write Sass code: Write your CSS styles using Sass syntax in the `.scss` file. Sass provides features like variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and more to make your CSS code more maintainable and efficient.

4. Compile Sass to CSS: Compile your Sass code into regular CSS using the Sass command in the terminal. Navigate to the directory where your `.scss` file is located and run the following command:

   sass styles.scss styles.css
   sass temp.scss styles.css



This command will compile your `styles.scss` file into a regular CSS file named `styles.css`.

5. Link the CSS file: Link the compiled CSS file (`styles.css`) in your HTML file using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

Here's an example of how your Sass file (`styles.scss`) might look:

scss
$primary-color: #3498db;

body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

.container {
    width: 80%;
    margin: 0 auto;

    .header {
        background-color: $primary-color;
        color: white;
        padding: 10px;
    }

    .content {
        padding: 20px;
    }
}
